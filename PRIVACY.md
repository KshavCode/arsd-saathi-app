# 🔒 Privacy Policy
**ArsdSaathi** is built with a "Privacy-by-Design" philosophy. We believe your academic data belongs to you and should remain under your control.

### 1. Data Collection & Usage
* **No Server-Side Storage:** ArsdSaathi does **not** have a central database or backend server. We do not collect, store, or monitor your personal information.
* **Direct Integration:** The app connects directly to the official ARSD College Student Portal. It acts as a specialized browser that fetches your information and displays it in a mobile-friendly format.

### 2. Local Storage
* **Credentials:** Your College Roll Number, Name, and Date of Birth are stored **locally** on your device using `AsyncStorage`. This is done solely to keep you logged in and allow for offline access to your synced data.
* **Encryption:** Data stored on your device is sandboxed by the Android operating system, meaning other apps cannot access ArsdSaathi's local storage.

### 3. Third-Party Services
* **Analytics:** We do **not** use any third-party analytics to track your usage patterns.
* **External Links:** The app provide links to the developers' profile links.

### 4. Data Deletion
* You can delete all your data instantly by clicking **"Logout"** inside the app or by clearing the app's cache/storage in your phone's Android settings.
